# PyCitySchools 

This project answers some set questions about some data, which have to be imported, merged, and manipulated in various ways in order to find the results. 

Detailed comments and conclusions are in the code file.



## Conclusions
1:
There is a huge difference in passing outcomes between Charter schools and District schools; according to these data, charter schools produce 90% of students passing reading and maths, compared with only 54% passing in District schools.

However this could be a correlation due to a third variable, such as the types of families who choose to send their children to these schools.

2:
Charter schools are on average much smaller than district schools. The data imply that students perform better in smaller schools.

3:
Interestingly, according to this data, charter schools have better educational outcomes than district schools despite a lower per-student budget.

Perhaps having more flexibility in setting their own curriculum has enabled Charter schools to focus on only activities that contribute to on-paper success? only a broader measure of success than reading and maths will shed light on this.
